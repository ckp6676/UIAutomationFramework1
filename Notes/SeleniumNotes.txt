how to scroll-down
how to switch to window?
There are some ways that we can use to switch to windows. Using window handles, defualt content, parentFrame()
Also we can use set collection for that.
we have to store our current window handle into one variable then for other window use enhance for loop to store values and we can switch all window by using that loop
other way;
Make sure you see about giving parameters for multiple browser opening
When you are doing BrowserStack make sure you store name in global variable and comment reading of propertyfile reader statement as we are initializing that in before test
Make sure you read testNG imp questions all
For running testcases through command line you need maven install in your local machine and then from cmd mvn clean test by directing your project in cmd
For parallel run add parallel in your groups.xml, and then it will run parallely, and it runs as n group of 5
Thread-count meaning?
Thread count refers to the number of threads or strands per square inch of fabric, counting horizontal and vertical threads.
Any third party file which is not related to java throws checked exception(IOException)

>To run test method multiple times in a loop, we can use invocationCount parameter and setting its value yo an integer value, makes the test method run n number of times.
example:- @Test(invocationCount= 5)
>Default priority of testNG is
>Soft Assertion vs hard Assertion:- by soft assertion, we can give multiple assertions and call all of them by softAssert.assertALL() method.
                                    In softAssertion if test methods fails, test method will still execute.
                                    Hard assertion is provided by TestNG.Here if assertion fails, execution will stop.
> To fail testNG test case if it is not executing within certain time, we can use @Test(timeout=1000).
>To skip test cases conditionally, use skipException.

>For scrolling using javaScriptExecutor, ((JavaScriptExecutor) driver).executescript("window.scrollBy(0,500)"where 0,500 is pixel

>For entering text without sendKeys, we can do by javaScriptExecutor.
 javaScriptExecutor jse = new (javaScriptExecutor) driver;
 jse.executeScript("text");
>To verifying, alert is present, we can use explicit wait.
 WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver,10);
 Alert alert = wait(untilExpectedConditions.alertIsPresent());
 alert.authenticateUsing(**username**,**password**));
